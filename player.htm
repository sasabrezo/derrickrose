		<hr>
		<p align="justify">Standing at 6 feet 3 inches tall (1.91 m) and weighing 190 pounds (86 kg), Rose plays mostly at point guard. Prior to his injury troubles, Rose established himself as one of the most athletic point guards in NBA history. Primarily a slasher, he averages 19.9 points per game for his career. During his MVP run, Rose was especially known for his ability to convert difficult layups. The biggest weakness cited in Rose's ability is his three-point shooting; he has a career average of 30.0% on three-point field goal attempts. He is also a poor jump shooter, but he has developed into a better bank-shot shooter since his eye problems affected his depth perception. He has made nearly 70% of his bank shots, even when he only made 40% of his shots.</p>
